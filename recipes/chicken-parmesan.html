        <p>
            An appetizing chicken parmesan recipe by popular youtuber Adam Ragusea.
        </p>
        <p>
            It uses panko breading and fried pecorino cheese. Since I live in Japan, it sounds like a great recipe to try while I'm living here.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Two chicken breasts</li>
            <li>Glug of white wine</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Four cloves of garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>One shallot, chopped</li>
            <li>Two tablespoons of tomato paste</li>
            <li>One 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>Handful of flour</li>
            <li>One egg, beaten</li>
            <li>Two cups of Panko</li>
            <li>Grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese</li>
            <li>Half-pound of spaghetti</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves, torn</li>   
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cut the chicken breasts to half their original thickness, yielding four equal pieces. Pound them out on both
                sides, ideally with a spiked meat mallet. Season both sides liberally with salt and pepper. Put the chicken in a
                bowl with some of the chopped garlic and just enough white wine to coat. Toss and refrigerate.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the tomato sauce, fry the shallots and the remaining garlic in olive oil until soft. Put in the tomato paste
                and fry briefly, then the canned tomatoes and a glug of white wine. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook for about
                30 minutes, stirring frequently to keep it from burning.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the sauce is about ready, prepare to bread the chicken by putting the flour and breadcrumbs onto separate
                plates and the beaten egg in a bowl. Grate a large pile of cheese onto the breadcrumbs and toss to mix it in.
                Dry the marinade off the chicken on paper towels.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put a pot of salted water on the boil for the spaghetti.
            </li>
            <li>
                Coat each piece of chicken in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs/cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour a heavy coating of olive oil into a wide pan on medium heat. Fry the chicken gently, two pieces at a time,
                until golden on both sides and the internal temperature reads 160 F — 6-8 minutes. Remove cooked chicken to a
                cooling rack. You’ll probably need to add more olive oil for the second batch.
            </li>
            <li>
                Start the spaghetti cooking when you start frying the second batch of chicken, and drain it when finished.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add basil to the tomato sauce, pour some sauce into the drained spaghetti and toss. Divide spaghetti onto four
                serving plates and top with grated cheese. Place a few dollops of sauce around the outside of each plate and
                place the chicken pieces. Dip each bite of chicken into the sauce as you eat.
            </li>
        </ol>
