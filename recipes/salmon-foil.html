        <h2>Ingredients - Serves 4</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 fillets, raw salmon</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>1/2 bunch shimeji mushrooms</li>
            <li>1/2 carrot</li>
            <li>Sprinkle parsley (seasoning)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cube bouillon</li>
            <li>Butter to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Pour a small amount of sake on raw salmon and sprinkle a bit of salt on both sides. Let sit for 5-10 minutes.
                (The salt
                is to remove any raw fish smell.) Once moisture is drawn from the fillets, wipe them down with paper towels.
            </li>
            <li>
                Thinly slice onions and carrots. Separate shimeji mushrooms into bite-size pieces, and mince parsley.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season raw salmon with salt and pepper. Finely crush the bouillon cube.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread sheets of aluminum foil. Make a bed with the onions and carrots, then sprinkle some of the crushed
                bouillon onto
                them. Place the salmon and shimeji on top, then fnially add 5-10 grams (1-2 tsp) of butter before wrapping it
                all in
                foil. (Make sure that the salmon skin doesn't touch the vegetables. If it does, the vegetables will end up
                smelling a
                bit like the skin.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the foil packets from (4) onto a frying pan, then steam over low heat for about 15-20 minutes. (If you're
                worried about the packets sticking to the frying pan, pour a little water in it when steaming.)
            </li>
            <li>
                After confirming that the fish is fully cooked, sprinkle parsley on top. All done!
            </li>
        </ol>
