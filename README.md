This is my first project for TOP. It is a recipe website that shows a main index page featuring a list of three recipes.

I used one of my favorite recipes by a Youtuber I like, and two featured in an anime that I am a fan of.

I used mostly HTML to complete the website. Because I used images from videos in 1080p, I used some basic inline styling CSS to change their size to better fit my screen.

I'm looking forward to learning more CSS as well, since the site size is difficult to read on a phone without zooming in.
